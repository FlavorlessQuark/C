## The complex stuff

- [x] Basic _ARRAY define

- [ ] Memory resize to _n

- [ ] Error checks on _Array | Possibly in a separate function

- [ ] Moar tests

- [ ] NULL condition checks & tests

- [ ] Add conversion functions

- [ ] Invalid function test / checks | Maybe not, if people want to purposefully pass something illegal, it's not my problem...

-----

- [ ] Generalize merge sort for any kind of list data

- [ ] List quicksort

- [ ] Array merge sort


----

- [ ] See about iterators for lists | aray types might require containers

- [ ] Print_list generalize , same kind of problem as array conversion with type checking stuff

----

- [ ] Dictionaries

## The easy stuff

- [ ] 2D Array allocation | Should be recursive...

- [ ] File parsing into array

- [ ] List uitlity functions

## The in-betweenstuff

- [ ] Memory macros for resizing at will

- [ ] Mapping macro | Might be nice to have iterators for this, or can just split into Map_array  and map_list
